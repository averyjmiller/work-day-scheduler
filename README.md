* User's are able to save events for each hour of the day.
* Work Day Scheduler is great for individuals with busy schedules who need a way to organize the appointments that they have for the day.
* The UI featured in Work Day Scheduler, such as the color-coded time blocks, makes it easy to differentiate the user's events for the day based on the current hour.

    * Green - this event has yet to happen
2. Click on your desired time block and type the events that are within that hour of the day
3. Click the save icon to the right of the time block to save your event to ```local storage```
